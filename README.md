![](london-properties.jpg "london-properties.jpg")

Use this Streamlit web app to estimate the short-term rental nightly price of your property based on its characteristics and location in London UK. The estimator takes as input property type, room type, number of people the property can accommodate, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, borough of the property location, yearly availabiliy of the property, days from last review (if any), distance of the property to the nearest Tube station and local amenities in the vicinity of the property. The app also takes into account the borough crime rate as a feature to estimate property rent price. Short-term rentals are those where the overnights stay is from 1 to 999 days. The data set used for the web app refers to December 2024. If you're curious, take a look at the web app at the link below.
